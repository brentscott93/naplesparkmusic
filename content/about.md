# Hi, I'm Denny 
I am the owner and operator of Naples Park Music. I opened the store right here in the Naples Park Plaza in 1992 selling musical instruments, giving lessons, and doing repairs. 30 years later I am still excited to be continuing our success! 

NPM is a 100% family owned and operated business. My two kids grew up running around the store and even now my oldest son Keith still helps out in his off-time from his professional trade as an audio engineer. Also, you can keep a look out for a rare sighting of our accountant and my wife Cindi who helps keep us on the straight and narrow. My youngest son Brent currently lives in Massachusetts and manages this website. 

Please stop on by the store anytime to ask questions, pick up some gear, or share some words of wisdom for the day. We are a small family staff of working musicians and sound professionals so sometimes we have non-traditional retail hours. Check out our social media sites or give us a call for the current happenings!
