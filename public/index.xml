      <description>Hi, I&#39;m Denny   I am the owner and operator of Naples Park Music. I opened the store right here in the Naples Park Plaza in 1992 selling musical instruments, giving lessons, and doing repairs. 30 years later I am still excited to be continuing our success! Please stop on by anytime to ask questions, pick up some gear, or share some words of wisdom for the day.</description>
